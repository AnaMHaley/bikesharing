# Overview of Project


The goal is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.  Using New York City (NYC) as a baseline, we put together a few different analyses in order to make useful recommendations. The findings have been divided into five sections:

1.	City Facts: Census data was used to illustrate key differences between New York City and Des Moines

2.	Rider Data: Citi Bike dataset was used to find rider trends in NYC

3.	User Type Data: Citi Bike dataset was used to compare behaviors between subscribers and one-off customers

4.	Age and Gender Data: Citi Bike dataset was used to compare behaviors between riders of different ages and genders

5.	Maintenance Data: Citi Bike dataset was used to provide insights on bike usage and the need for bike maintenance




# Analysis & Results


1.	City Demographics:



•	NYC's population is significantly larger than Des Moines

•	It takes twice as much time to commute in NYC

•	Income per capita is 38% higher in NYC

•	Des Moines' population is slightly younger than NYC



2.	Rider Data:




•	Most days have the same number of trips

•	Majority of bike rides don't exceed 20 minutes

•	There are two usage peaks:  morning and late afternoon



3.	User Type Data:




•	Majority of riders are subscribers

•	The average customer ride duration is twice as long as subscribers 

•	Trip duration is consistent for subscribers throughout the day which may indicate most subscribers have the same transportation pattern day-to-day

•	Subscribers are mostly millennials


4.	Age and Gender Data:




•	Riders between the ages of 25-34 have the most trips taken

•	Riders between the ages of 45-54 an average trip duration of almost 25 minutes

•	Majority of rides are taken by male subscribers



5.	Maintenance Data:





•	Some bikes have up to 2.8 times the average mileage of all bikes, which indicates that they might be up for maintenance or should be replaced





# Observations



1.	The population of Des Moines is significantly smaller than New York City, which means less volume of riders overall


2.	Des Moines commute time coincide with the average trip duration in NYC, which leads us to think that promoting biking as an additional commute option could be beneficial


3.	Monthly rider subscribers are huge factor to the success in NYC as it provides consistent revenue and encourages users to use the service. Des Moines should follow this trend

4.	Des Moines population is slightly younger than NYC, and NYC riders tend to be amongst the same age range. It may be easier to attract young riders


5.	Maintenance data shows bikes can run well; up to 500 miles and more. In square miles, Des Moines is 3x smaller than NYC.  This most likely will result in ilower costs in bike maintenance
