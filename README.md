# Summary

These visualizations have the potential to provide excellent insights into the trends of a business that would be critical for expansion discussions within the same city or expansion into other cities.  From a business standpoint in order to attract additional investors, visualizations that depict revenue, cost and profit by a variety of demographics would be very useful.
